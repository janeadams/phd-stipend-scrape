The required fees are the quarterly Student Life Fee.<br>If you do not take classes in the summer,<br>you pay $380 less than the $1520 stated.<br>In exchange for the Student Life Fee,<br>you get free access to general physician,<br>as well as events (social events,<br>yoga classes,<br>mental health activities etc).<br>
Rent in Hyde Park area is around $1100-1600 for a one-bed room apartment,<br>less for a studio or room in shared apartment.<br>
The University also pays for the PhD student&#39;s health insurance (United Healthcare)<br>which covers a lot.<br>The Out of Pocket is $500,<br>and co-pay of 10% goes until another $1000.<br>So if you have medical costs above $1500 everything is paid for.

For humanities students,<br>there are limited resources for funds for conference travels etc.<br>Costs outside of rent/gas/phone bills/groceries need some managing,<br>but everything depends on the rent situation.<br>Many graduate students live in shared housing,<br>and can thus afford a conference every once in a while.

Many students in the humanities have some sort of student job,<br>e.g.<br>working at publications office,<br>helping professors with databases,<br>publications,<br> working at the language center,<br>UChicago Grad etc.<br>These often pay around $15/hour,<br>but it can also be less.<br>

PhD-students with families can get $2000 extra a year from the University.<br>This is officially for child care,<br>but can be spend any way you want.<br>This does not cover child care premiums (ca.<br>$1100-1800 a month per child in the area,<br>depending on the facility).<br>
